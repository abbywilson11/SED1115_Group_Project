"""
Initialize pins for:
- X and Y axis potentiometers (analog inputs)
- Pen up/down button and reset buttons (digital inputs)
- Shoulder and elbow servo control (PWM outputs)
Set the PWM frequency (typically 50 Hz for standard servos).

# Define initial state, boundaries, and buttons/knob setup

"""
Define initial variables, set the initial pen state (up/down), and the initial arm position.
Establish boundaries for the arm’s movement area (e.g., paper surface).

    Reads the analog input from a potentiometer and converts it to an angle.

    adc_pin (ADC): The ADC pin connected to the potentiometer.
    Returns:
    int: Mapped angle between Min_Angle and Max_Angle.

def map_to_angle(knob_value):
    """
    Maps the potentiometer readings to an angle for servo control.

    knob_value (int): Raw potentiometer value
    Returns:
    int: Mapped angle within the defined angle range

    Sets the PWM duty cycle for servos based on calculations to get the desired angle.

    angle (int): The desired angle for the servo
